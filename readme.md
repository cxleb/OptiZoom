# OptiZoom
For Minecraft `1.18.2`

This is Optifine's zoom feature for Minecraft under the fabric loader, made for me and my friends.

Default key is left control, like in optifine, but can be rebound under the key binds menu.

Compatible with the vanilla renderer and the Sodium renderer!

Requires the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) mod, unfortunately

Inspired by the (unmaintained) [Optifine Zoom](https://github.com/Ivan-1F/OptifineZoom) mod
